## Introduction

This directory contains a Pytorch/Pytorch Lightning implementation of transformers applied to time series. 
We focus on Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformers. 

Transformer-XL is described in this paper 
[Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860)
by Zihang Dai\*, Zhilin Yang\*, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Quoc V. Le, Ruslan Salakhutdinov
